Overview
The Polymarket Real-Time Data Socket (RTDS) is a WebSocket-based streaming service that provides real-time updates for various Polymarket data streams. The service allows clients to subscribe to multiple data feeds simultaneously and receive live updates as events occur on the platform.
Polymarket provides a Typescript client for interacting with this streaming service.
