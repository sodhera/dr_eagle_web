Bridge & Swap
Get Supported Assets
Retrieve all supported chains and tokens for deposits and withdrawals.
USDC.e on Polygon:
Polymarket uses USDC.e (Bridged USDC from Ethereum) on Polygon as the native collateral for all markets. When you deposit assets from other chains, they are automatically bridged and swapped to USDC.e on Polygon, which is then used as collateral for trading on Polymarket.
Minimum Deposit Amounts:
Each asset has a
minCheckoutUsd
field indicating the minimum deposit amount required in USD. Make sure your deposit meets this minimum to avoid transaction failures.
