Developer Quickstart
Your First Order
Placing your first order using one of our two Clients is relatively straightforward.
For Python:
pip install py-clob-client
.
For Typescript:
npm install polymarket/clob-client
&
npm install ethers
.
After installing one of those you will be able to run the below code. Take the time to fill in the constants at the top and ensure you’re using the proper signature type based on your login method.
Many additional examples for the Typescript and Python clients are available
here(TS)
and
here(Python)
.

In addition to detailed comments in the code snippet, here are some more tips to help you get started.
See the Python example for details on the proper way to initialize a Py-Clob-Client depending on your wallet type. Three exhaustive examples are given. If using a MetaMask wallet or EOA please see the resources
here
, for instructions on setting allowances.
When buying into a market you purchase a “Token” that token represents either a Yes or No outcome of the event. To easily get required token pairs for a given event we have provided an interactive endpoint
here
.
Common pitfalls:
Negrisk Markets require an additional flag in the OrderArgs
negrisk=False
invalid signature
error, likely due to one of the following.
Incorrect Funder and or Private Key
Incorrect NegRisk flag in your order arguments
not enough balance / allowance
.
Not enough USDC to perform the trade. See the formula at the bottom of
this
page for details.
