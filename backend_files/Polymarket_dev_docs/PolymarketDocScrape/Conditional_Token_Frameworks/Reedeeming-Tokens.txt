Conditional Token Frameworks
Reedeeming Tokens
Once a condition has had it’s payouts reported (ie by the UMACTFAdapter calling
reportPayouts
on the CTF contract), users with shares in the winning outcome can redeem them for the underlying collateral. Specifically, users can call the
redeemPositions
function on the CTF contract which will burn all valuable conditional tokens in return for collateral according to the reported payout vector. This function has the following parameters:
collateralToken
: IERC20 - The address of the positions’ backing collateral token.
parentCollectionId
: bytes32 - The ID of the outcome collections common to the position being redeemed. Null in Polymarket case.
indexSets
: uint[] - The ID of the condition to redeem.
indexSets
: uint[] - An array of disjoint index sets representing a nontrivial partition of the outcome slots of the given condition. E.G. A|B and C but not A|B and B|C (is not disjoint). Each element’s a number which, together with the condition, represents the outcome collection. E.G. 0b110 is A|B, 0b010 is B, etc. In the Polymarket case 1|2.
