Polymarket provides code samples in both Python and TypeScript for interacting
with our smart chain contracts. You will need an RPC endpoint to access the
blockchain, and you’ll be responsible for paying gas fees when executing these
RPC/function calls. Please ensure you’re using the correct example for your wallet
type (Safe Wallet vs Proxy Wallet) when implementing.
