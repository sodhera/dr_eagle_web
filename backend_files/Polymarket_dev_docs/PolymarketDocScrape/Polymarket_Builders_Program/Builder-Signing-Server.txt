Builder Signing Server
Self-hosted server for secure remote signing of builder authentication headers
​
Overview
The Builder Signing Server is a self-hosted Express.js application that enables remote signing of builder authentication headers. By running this server, you can keep your Builder API credentials secure on your own infrastructure while still allowing your application to sign requests.
This server is designed to work with both the
CLOB Client
for order attribution and the
Relayer Client
for gasless transactions.
​
Why Use Remote Signing?
Remote signing provides enhanced security by:
Isolating credentials
: Your Builder API keys never leave your secure server
Centralized key management
: Manage credentials in one secure location
Reduced exposure
: Client applications don’t need direct access to sensitive keys
​
Installation
​
Prerequisites
Node.js
: v18 or higher
yarn
or npm
​
Clone and Install
Copy
Ask AI
# Clone the repository
git
clone
https://github.com/Polymarket/builder-signing-server.git
cd
builder-signing-server
# Install dependencies
yarn
install
​
Configuration
​
Environment Variables
Create a
.env
file in the root directory with your Builder API credentials:
Copy
Ask AI
PORT
=
5001
POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY
=
your_builder_api_key
POLY_BUILDER_SECRET
=
your_builder_secret
POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE
=
your_builder_passphrase
Security
: Never commit your
.env
file to version control. Add it to
.gitignore
to prevent accidental exposure of your credentials.
​
Port Configuration
You can run the server on any port you choose. The default is
5001
, but you can change this by setting the
PORT
environment variable. Make sure to configure your client applications to use the same port:
Copy
Ask AI
// In your client application
const
builderConfig
=
new
BuilderConfig
({
remoteBuilderConfig:
{
url:
"http://localhost:3000/sign"
}
});
​
Running the Server
​
Development Mode
For development with automatic reloading:
Copy
Ask AI
yarn
start-dev
​
Production Mode
Build and run the compiled version:
Copy
Ask AI
# Start the production server
yarn
start
The server will start and display:
Copy
Ask AI
Builder signing server listening on :5001
​
Client Integration
​
With CLOB Client
Configure the CLOB client to use your signing server for order attribution:
Copy
Ask AI
import
{
ClobClient
}
from
"@polymarket/clob-client"
;
import
{
BuilderConfig
}
from
"@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk"
;
const
builderConfig
=
new
BuilderConfig
({
remoteBuilderConfig:
{
url:
"http://localhost:3000/sign"
}
});
const
clobClient
=
new
ClobClient
(
host
,
chainId
,
wallet
,
creds
,
SignatureType
.
POLY_PROXY
,
funderAddress
,
undefined
,
false
,
builderConfig
);
// Orders will automatically use the signing server
const
order
=
await
clobClient
.
createOrder
({
price:
0.40
,
side:
Side
.
BUY
,
size:
5
,
tokenID:
"27072675915285915455116137912884489109876947142577610372904917850067886308458"
});
const
response
=
await
clobClient
.
postOrder
(
order
);
​
With Relayer Client
Configure the relayer client to use your signing server for gasless transactions:
Copy
Ask AI
import
{
RelayClient
}
from
"@polymarket/builder-relayer-client"
;
import
{
BuilderConfig
}
from
"@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk"
;
const
builderConfig
=
new
BuilderConfig
({
remoteBuilderConfig:
{
url:
"http://localhost:3000/sign"
}
});
const
relayClient
=
new
RelayClient
(
relayerUrl
,
chainId
,
wallet
,
builderConfig
);
// Transactions will automatically use the signing server
const
response
=
await
relayClient
.
deploySafe
();
const
result
=
await
response
.
wait
();
​
Production Deployment
​
Troubleshooting
​
Server Won’t Start
Issue
:
Error: POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY environment variable is required
Solution
: Ensure your
.env
file contains all required variables:
POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY
POLY_BUILDER_SECRET
POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE
​
Port Already in Use
Issue
:
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5001
Solution
: Change the port in your
.env
file:
Copy
Ask AI
PORT
=
5002
And update your client configuration accordingly.
​
Invalid Signature Errors
Issue
: Client receives invalid signature errors
Solution
:
Verify the request body is being passed correctly as a JSON string
Check that the path and method match exactly what the client is sending
Ensure your server and client are using the same Builder API credentials
