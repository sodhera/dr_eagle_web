Polymarket Builders Program
Order Attribution
Learn how to attribute customer orders to your builder account using authentication headers
​
Overview
The order attribution system allows builders to attach custom headers to their customer orders before posting them to the CLOB. These additional headers enable Polymarket to attribute orders to your specific builder account, providing visibility into which orders originate from your platform.
​
Builder API Credentials
Each builder will receive Builder API Key Credentials that look like this:
Copy
Ask AI
interface
BuilderApiKeyCreds
{
key
:
string
;
secret
:
string
;
passphrase
:
string
;
}
// Example structure
const
builderCreds
=
{
key:
"xxxxx....."
,
secret:
"xxxxx....."
,
passphrase:
"xxxxx....."
};
Security Notice
: Your Builder API keys must be kept secure. We provide both local and remote signing methods to help you protect these credentials.
​
Signing Methods
There are two methods available for signing orders and adding attribution headers:
Remote Signing
and
Local Signing
.
​
Remote Signing (Recommended)
Remote signing is the recommended approach for protecting your Builder API credentials. With this method, your credentials never leave your secure server.
How it works:
Your customer signs an order payload (ready to be sent to the CLOB)
Instead of sending directly to the CLOB, the signed payload is sent to your builder signing server
Your builder signing server uses your Builder API keys to cryptographically sign the entire payload and adds the authentication headers
The fully signed payload (signed by both your customer and you as the builder) is then sent to the CLOB
Implementation:
We provide a complete server implementation in the
@polymarket/builder-signing-server
repository.

const

Remote Builder Configuration:
Copy
Ask AI
interface
RemoteBuilderConfig
{
url
:
string
;
// URL of your signing server
token
?:
string
;
// Optional authorization token
}
The optional
token
parameter allows you to add an authorization header to requests sent to your signing server, providing an additional layer of security.
​
Local Signing
If you control the entire order placement flow (including signing for your customers), you can sign orders locally before sending them to the CLOB.
How it works:
Your system creates and signs the order on behalf of your customer
Your system uses your Builder API credentials locally to add authentication headers
The complete signed order with builder headers is sent directly to the CLOB
Implementation:
Copy
Ask AI
import
{
ClobClient
}
from
"@polymarket/clob-client"
;
import
{
BuilderConfig
,
BuilderApiKeyCreds
}

});
const

await
clobClient
.
postOrder
(
order
);
​
Authentication Headers
The builder signing process adds the following headers to each order request:
POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY
: Your builder API key
POLY_BUILDER_TIMESTAMP
: Unix timestamp of when the signature was created
POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE
: Your builder passphrase
POLY_BUILDER_SIGNATURE
: HMAC signature of the request
These headers are automatically generated and attached by the SDK - you don’t need to construct them manually.
​
Using Our SDKs
Important
: We strongly recommend using our official SDKs and server implementations. You
do not
need to implement the signing logic yourself.
We provide the following packages to handle all signing and header injection:
@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk
: Core signing functionality
@polymarket/builder-signing-server
: Production-ready remote signing server
@polymarket/clob-client
: Updated CLOB client with built-in builder support
All examples in this documentation use these official packages to ensure security and reliability.
